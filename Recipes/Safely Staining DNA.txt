Safely Staining DNA

     "My personal foci are safety, ease of
     visualisation (non-UV please), impact on DNA (no UV please!!) and ease of
     disposal.
     *Methylene blue* has been discussed before. Apparently using a lower
     concentration can reduce background staining while not affecting sensitivity
     to DNA (that's a matter of DNA quantity, not methylene blue concentration).
     Unfortunately it takes between 3 and 5 times as much DNA to absorb
     noticeable amounts of methylene blue, compared to EtBr. Also, it degrades
     over time, so keep in the fridge, minimise contact with oxygen and cover
     container with tinfoil.
     *Crystal Violet* can apparently be used, and is moderately safe. It's
     generally considered safe as an alternative antifungal treatment for
     breastfeeding mothers (my sister has used it lots), so I think it qualifies
     as a "home safe" dye. There are some very mild carcinogenic concerns, but
     they apply to regular consumption rather than the occasional topical
     exposure.
     The method detailed in a closed-access paper I've skimmed goes roughly like
     this: Run DNA in an unstained Gel, then stain the gel for 30 mins with
     0.001% Crystal violet. Apparently this is more sensitive than EtBr. For
     better sensitivity, use 0.0025 CV with 0.0005% *Methyl Orange*, if you can
     get some. Visualise on a regular light box, not UV. Paper: "Counterion-dye
     staining method for DNAin agarose gels using crystal violet and methyl
     orange."
     According to this:

     You can also use "*Nile Blue*" as a dye, and this is used in some/many
     commercial running buffers that let you see the DNA moving during
     electrophoresis. This stuff isn't perfect, see the MSDS:
     http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9926230. It's also not exactly
     commonly available, being used as a histology stain or a photosensitiser in
     light-directed chemotherapy. Worth noting though.
     I've seen several alternatives to Sybr-Safe that are chemically a mystery,
     but you can find some for sale here:
     http://nbsbio.co.uk/categories.asp?cID=75. According to the sales rep I was
     talking to, the *Safeview/Safewhite* stains are blue-light excitable, even
     if the datasheet disagrees. I suspect "*Visual violet*" is a formulation of
     Crystal Violet, used as an in-gel stain. They also have "*EZ-Vision*", for
     which more detail is available here:
     http://www.mobitec.de/de/products/bio/02_genomics/ez-vision.html. Apparently
     it requires transillumination.
     So, there's a bunch of alternatives. My money's on Crystal Violet and
     Methylene blue. You might even be able to combine the two for the
     best-of-both approach: Meth blue seems to bind the outside of DNA helix, so
     if CV intercalates into the actual base-pairing site there might be no
     conflict."
