Czapek's Solution Agar is a synthetic medium widely used in mycological laboratories. Many
moulds produce very characteristic colonies on it and may also exude pigmented substances.
Aerial growth is often suppressed and sporulation may be enhanced. Some moulds, however,
grow poorly on this medium and may even fail to sporulate altogether, often because of their
inability to synthesize vitamins.
