Inhibitory Mould Agar (IMA)


An enriched medium containing chloramphenicol (while some IMA plates also contain gentamicin) to prevent the growth 
of bacteria – and are recommended for isolation of fungi from materials having an extensive flora of other fungi or
 bacteria.

IMA supports the growth of a wide range of fungi and due to the presence of antibiotics inhibits the growth of most
 bacteria more effectively than other fungal culture media (Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA)).  In prior studies IMA has 
been found to support the growth of four times more fungal isolates when compared to SDA [1].  There are exceptions 
to this “rule” and Rhodotorula spp. (growth is affected by chloramphenicol) and some hyaline hyphomycetes may grow 
less well/not at all on IMA.

This media is commercially available from a number of companies.  Plates should be “deep-filled” to prevent drying 
during prolonged incubation and checked twice a week for growth.
