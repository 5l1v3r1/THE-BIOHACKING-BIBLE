Dilute Salts (for inducing oomycete zoosporogenesis) makes 1 litre each stock. Store at 4°C.
DSA


13.6 g KH2PO4
17.4 g K2HPO4
13.2 g (NH4)2SO4
DSB
7.4 g CaCl2.2H2O
10.2 g MgCl2.6H2O


To use the Dilute Salts stocks, put 500 ml of distilled water in a 1000 ml flask, add 0.5 ml DSA
and 1.0 ml DSB, swirl to mix well, and add distilled water to one litre. Swirl again. Mixing
stocks directly causes precipitation.


To induce zoosporogenesis: grow oomycete cultures of in liquid OM, overnight, starting with
very small inocula, ~1mm3. Remove OM by aspiration, and replace with dilute salts. Remove
replace two or three times in the first hour, and then once an hour. Should have good zoospore
release by 4-5 h
