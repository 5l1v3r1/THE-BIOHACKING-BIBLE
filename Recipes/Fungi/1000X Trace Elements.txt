1. Dissolve these salts in 80 ml of distilled water in the order indicated:
FeSO4 ·7H2O (ferrous sulphate) 1.0g
Disodium EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetate) 10.0g
Adjust pH upwards with KOH pellets. A golden yellow solution results above ~ pH 5.5, and
this is sufficient to proceed.
2. Dissolve these salts in 80 ml of distilled water in the order indicated:
ZnSO4·7H2O (zinc sulphate) 4.4g
H3BO3 (boric acid) 2.2g
MnCl2·4H2O (manganous chloride) 1.0g
CoCl2·6H2O (cobaltous chloride) 0.32g
CuSO4·5H2O (cupric sulphate) 0.32g
(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O (ammonium molybdate) 0.22g
Combine Solutions (1) and (2), and readjust the pH to 6.5 using first KOH pellets, then KOH
solutions of decreasing concentration. Bring the final volume to 200 ml with distilled water,
and store at 4-8°C. As with traditionally prepared Hutner's TE, this solution is initially bright
green, turning purple upon storage. Precipitates are never formed
