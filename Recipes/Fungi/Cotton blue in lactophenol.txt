Cotton blue in lactophenol


20 g phenol crystals
20 g lactic acid
40 g glycerine
20 g water
0.1 g cotton blue

NB: lactophenol polymerizes/esterifies with time. This changes the osmolality of the solution so
that it causes plasmolysis. Other blue dyes are probably similar to cotton blue -- trypan blue or
toluidine blue; Dave Malloch suggests ink blue
