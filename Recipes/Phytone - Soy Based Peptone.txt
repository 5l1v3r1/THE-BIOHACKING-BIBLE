Phytone - Soy Based Peptone



This Recipe using 100% Soy protein Isolate to make Soy Phytone, a close analogue of Tryptone.

. 50Gr. Soy Protein Isolate
. 500Ml. Deionised or Mineral Water
. 1000GDUs or a generous dose of Powder (1+tsp) Bromelain (or Meat Tenderiser)



Dissolve the Soy protein fully in water, then heat the rsulting broth until simmering.
Lower the heat, but keep very hot for 5 minutes. This may help to degrade any 
protease-inhibitors that might be lurkin in your soy protein, wich would prevent
bromelain from doing its job. We'll be adding so much bromalaine that this maightn't
matter, but everything helps. Cooking the protein will also help pre-degrade the protein, 
wich may help the bromalaine digest it. Allow the mix to cool until is slightly hot the touch, 
and keep it in that way.About 45C°should in wich it can work. At this point, dissolve
in the bromelain. Keep warm and stir occasionally for about 20 minutes. Then simmer for
another 5 minutes to deactivate the bromelain enzymes. You can simmer the protein to reduce
it down or ever dry it out, but you can also use it directly if you calculate the peptone
content. Redissolve any residues, measure the remaining fluid in your final mix.
Divide starting protein by remaining volume to get Peptone/Ml.
