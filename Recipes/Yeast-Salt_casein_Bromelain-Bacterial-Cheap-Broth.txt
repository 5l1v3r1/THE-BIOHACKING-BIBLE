Preparing Nutrient Broth for E.coli:


In 500mls water, mix 5g salt-free Yeast Extract, 2.5g non-iodised table salt, 5g casein or soy protein isolate, one crushed bromelain digestive 
aid tablets or a half-teaspoon of meat tenderiser.
Mix well, breaking up air-pockets and dissolving the yeast extract and salt. Dissolve as much of the protein as possible. Leave somewhere 
warm for 2hrs for the tenderiser/bromelain to act on the soy protein/casein.
Heat until steaming, stirring well, then filter; first through a fine sieve, then through a coffee filter, then through two fresh coffee 
filters. Keep filtering until transparent. As a final, slow filter, you can gently pack some cotton wool into a funnel, and filter through 
the packed cotton wool.
When fully filtered, divide into 50ml or 100ml volumes, add 20g/L Agar if Agar is desired, and sterilise in the microwave 
(detailed in protocol 3a, below) or pressure cooker (3b). Remember not to seal lids when sterilising!
When sterilised, allow to cool, add appropriate amount of antibiotics to some, and then leave in the fridge until use.
