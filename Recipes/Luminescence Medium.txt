This medium can be used to isolate and grow bioluminescent marine bacteria from fresh fish, shrimp or squid (or just seawater, sometimes...) 
It's pretty salty, so most non-marine bacteria won't grow well on it. It's requires addition of Glycerol as an energy source: 
it's more digestable by the bacteria to encourage vigorous light production, and some mightn't be able to grow on Tryptone alone. 
Note that reduce the ammount of Tryptone called for.
