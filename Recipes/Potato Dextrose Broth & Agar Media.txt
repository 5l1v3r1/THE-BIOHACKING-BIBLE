Potato Dextrose Broth & Agar Media

This simple medium is used to grow bacteria (or molds/fungi/yeasts) that attack plants
in the soil, and consists happily of only two key ingredients besides optional Agar.
Dextrose being not unlike normal sugar, will react oddly with other molecules as 
it caremelises in the autoclave, so sterilisation after pressure is reached shouldn't
exceed 15 minutes. You can use PDA to grow common yeasts used in the kitchen, perhaps to
breed your own strains or to test for the viability of your yeast before baking an 
important cake. Or maybe you'd like to grow up broths of yeast and make your own yeast extract!
