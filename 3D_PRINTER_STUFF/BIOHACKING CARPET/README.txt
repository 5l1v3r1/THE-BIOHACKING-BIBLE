D model description

This is the first of a series of objects I intend to throw to "hack" the brain. The Biohacking Carpet is a set of plastic nails that you can adjust to your pillow to exert acupressure on the neck or head. This is a millenary Indian technique that facilitates the release of serotonin (in response to light nail pressure), which in turn reduces anxiety and stress. With a little less anxiety and stress in your life, you'll be more productive and closer to achieving your goals.

Unlike the so-called "acupuncture pillows", the Biohacking carpet can be placed on the pillow you use every day or it can be carefully placed on the floor (making sure it doesn't get dirty) to apply the same technique to your feet.

C'est le premier d'une série d'objets à "hack" le cerveau. The Biohacking Carpet is an ensemble of plastic clous that you can adjust to your ear to perform an acupression on the head or on the head. C'est une technique millénaire indienne qui facilite la libération de sérotonine (en réponse à la légère pression exercée par les ongles), ce qui réduit l'anxiété et le stress. With a little less anxiety and stress in your life, you will be more productive and more likely to achieve your goals.

In contrast to the serum-disant "acupuncture oreillers", the Biohacking Carpet can be placed on the oreiller you use every day or on the sun with caution (in cherchant so that it does not leave) in order to apply the same technique to the feet.
